The paper builds on previous work directed to use Bluetooth scans to analyze social context and extends it with more advanced features, leveraging collaboration between close by devices, and the use of relative features that do not directly depend on the absolute number of devices in the environment. The method is evaluated on a data set from an experiment at the public viewing event in Kaiserslautern during the European soccer championship showing over 75{\%} recognition accuracy on seven discrete classes.},

abstract = {The ever increasing ubiquitousness of WiFi access points, coupled with the diffusion of smartphones, suggest that Internet every time and everywhere will soon (if not already has) become a reality. Even in presence of 3G connectivity, our devices are built to switch automatically to WiFi networks so to improve user experience. Most of the times, this is achieved by recurrently broadcasting automatic connectivity requests (known as Probe Requests) to known access points (APs), like, e.g., "Home WiFi", "Campus WiFi", and so on. In a large gathering of people, the number of these probes can be very high. This scenario rises a natural question: "Can significant information on the social structure of a large crowd and on its socioeconomic status be inferred by looking at smartphone probes?". In this work we give a positive answer to this question. We organized a 3-months long campaign, through which we collected around 11M probes sent by more than 160K different devices. During the campaign we targeted national and international events that attracted large crowds as well as other gatherings of people. Then, we present a simple and automatic methodology to build the underlying social graph of the smartphone users, starting from their probes. We do so for each of our target events, and find that they all feature social-network properties. In addition, we show that, by looking at the probes in an event, we can learn important sociological aspects of its participants---language, vendor adoption, and so on.},

abstract = {The rapid deployment of smartphones as all-purpose mobile computing systems has led to a wide adoption of wireless communication systems such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in mobile scenarios. Both communication systems leak information to the surroundings during operation. This information has been used for tracking and crowd density estimations in literature. However, an estimation of pedestrian flows has not yet been evaluated with respect to a known ground truth and, thus, a reliable adoption in real world scenarios is rather difficult. With this paper, we fill in this gap. Using ground truth provided by the security check process at a major German airport, we discuss the quality and feasibility of pedestrian flow estimations for both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth captures. We present and evaluate three approaches in order to improve the accuracy in comparison to a naive count of captured MAC addresses. Such counts only showed an impractical Pearson correlation of 0.53 for Bluetooth and 0.61 for Wi-Fi compared to ground truth. The presented extended approaches yield a superior correlation of 0.75 in best case. This indicates a strong correlation and an improvement of accuracy. Given these results, the presented approaches allow for a practical estimation of pedestrian flows.},

abstract = {Using Media-Access-Control (MAC) address for data collection and tracking is a capable and cost effective approach as the traditional ways such as surveys and video surveillance have numerous drawbacks and limitations. Positioning cell phones by Global System for Mobile communication was considered an attack on people's privacy. MAC addresses just keep a unique log of a WiFi or Bluetooth-enabled device for connecting to another device that has not potential privacy infringements. This paper presents the use of MAC address data collection approach for analysis of spatio-temporal dynamics of human in terms of shared space utilization. This paper firstly discuses the critical challenges and key benefits of MAC address data as a tracking technology for monitoring human movement. Here, proximity-based MAC address tracking is postulated as an effective methodology for analysing the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of human movements at shared zones such as lounge and office areas. A case study of university staff lounge area is described in detail and results indicates a significant added value of the methodology for human movement tracking. By analysis of MAC address data in the study area, clear statistics such as staff's utilisation frequency, utilisation peak periods, and staff time spent is obtained. The analyses also reveal staff's socialising profiles in terms of group and solo gathering. The paper is concluded with a discussion on why MAC address tracking offers significant advantages for tracking human behaviour in terms of shared space utilisation with respect to other and more prominent technologies, and outlines some of its remaining deficiencies.},

A case study of the Ghent Festivities event (1.5 million visitors over 10 days) is described in detail and preliminary results are shown to give an indication of the added value of the methodology for stakeholders of the event. By covering 22 locations in the study area with Bluetooth scanners, we were able to extract 152,487 trajectories generated by 80,828 detected visitors. Apart from generating clear statistics such as visitor counts, the share of returning visitors, and visitor flow maps, the analyses also reveal the complex nature of this event by hinting at the existence of several mutually different visitor profiles. We conclude by arguing why Bluetooth tracking offers significant advantages for tracking mass event visitors with respect to other and more prominent technologies, and outline some of its remaining deficiencies. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The approach combines an exploratory spatio-temporal analysis of geographic coordinates and dates representing locations and time of taking photos with basic thematic information available through the Google Maps Web mapping service, and interpretation of the analyzed area. The article describes data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the size of the dataset and focuses on information addressing research questions. The results of analysis for the Seattle metropolitan area help to distinguish between sites that are occasionally popular among the photographers and can be considered as potential attractions from sites that are regularly visited and already known as city landmarks. The analysis of photographers' movements across the metropolitan area shows that most photographers' itineraries are short and highly localized.},

Smartphones are already applied to assess information via self-reports. Related work also uses them to log context information or prompt event-specific self-reports. We see a high potential for them to be used for monitoring social interactions in in-field studies as they are constant companions in real life and a platform for virtual interactions. Our system will apply pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms to physical sensor measurements such as microphone and radio signals, but also to virtual sensor information such as call and message history and activity of messaging apps. We will evaluate to which extent and how well our system can automatically and unobtrusively find indicators for social interactions and, based on them, identify anomalies in the subject's behavior.},

abstract = {WiFi in indoor environments exhibits spatio-temporal variations in terms of coverage and interference in typical WLAN deployments with multiple APs, motivating the need for automated monitoring to aid network administrators to adapt the WLAN deployment in order to match the user expectations. We develop Pazl, a mobile crowdsensing based indoor WiFi monitoring system that is enabled by a novel hybrid localization mechanism to locate individual measurements taken from participant phones. The localization mechanism in Pazl integrates the best aspects of two well known localization techniques, pedestrian dead reckoning and WiFi fingerprinting; it also relies on crowdsourcing for constructing the WiFi fingerprint database. Compared to existing WiFi monitoring systems based on static sniffers, Pazl is low cost and provides a user-side perspective. Pazl is significantly more automated than wireless site survey tools such as Ekahau Mobile Survey tool by drastically reducing the manual point-and-click based measurement location determination. We implement Pazl through a combination of Android mobile app and cloud backend application on the Google App Engine. Experimental evaluation of Pazl with a trial set of users shows that it yields similar results to manual site surveys but without the tedium.},

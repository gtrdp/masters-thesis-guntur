abstract = {The ever increasing ubiquitousness of WiFi access points, coupled with the diffusion of smartphones, suggest that Internet every time and everywhere will soon (if not already has) become a reality. Even in presence of 3G connectivity, our devices are built to switch automatically to WiFi networks so to improve user experience. Most of the times, this is achieved by recurrently broadcasting automatic connectivity requests (known as Probe Requests) to known access points (APs), like, e.g., "Home WiFi", "Campus WiFi", and so on. In a large gathering of people, the number of these probes can be very high. This scenario rises a natural question: "Can significant information on the social structure of a large crowd and on its socioeconomic status be inferred by looking at smartphone probes?". In this work we give a positive answer to this question. We organized a 3-months long campaign, through which we collected around 11M probes sent by more than 160K different devices. During the campaign we targeted national and international events that attracted large crowds as well as other gatherings of people. Then, we present a simple and automatic methodology to build the underlying social graph of the smartphone users, starting from their probes. We do so for each of our target events, and find that they all feature social-network properties. In addition, we show that, by looking at the probes in an event, we can learn important sociological aspects of its participants---language, vendor adoption, and so on.},

abstract = {The rapid deployment of smartphones as all-purpose mobile computing systems has led to a wide adoption of wireless communication systems such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in mobile scenarios. Both communication systems leak information to the surroundings during operation. This information has been used for tracking and crowd density estimations in literature. However, an estimation of pedestrian flows has not yet been evaluated with respect to a known ground truth and, thus, a reliable adoption in real world scenarios is rather difficult. With this paper, we fill in this gap. Using ground truth provided by the security check process at a major German airport, we discuss the quality and feasibility of pedestrian flow estimations for both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth captures. We present and evaluate three approaches in order to improve the accuracy in comparison to a naive count of captured MAC addresses. Such counts only showed an impractical Pearson correlation of 0.53 for Bluetooth and 0.61 for Wi-Fi compared to ground truth. The presented extended approaches yield a superior correlation of 0.75 in best case. This indicates a strong correlation and an improvement of accuracy. Given these results, the presented approaches allow for a practical estimation of pedestrian flows.},

abstract = {Using Media-Access-Control (MAC) address for data collection and tracking is a capable and cost effective approach as the traditional ways such as surveys and video surveillance have numerous drawbacks and limitations. Positioning cell phones by Global System for Mobile communication was considered an attack on people's privacy. MAC addresses just keep a unique log of a WiFi or Bluetooth-enabled device for connecting to another device that has not potential privacy infringements. This paper presents the use of MAC address data collection approach for analysis of spatio-temporal dynamics of human in terms of shared space utilization. This paper firstly discuses the critical challenges and key benefits of MAC address data as a tracking technology for monitoring human movement. Here, proximity-based MAC address tracking is postulated as an effective methodology for analysing the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of human movements at shared zones such as lounge and office areas. A case study of university staff lounge area is described in detail and results indicates a significant added value of the methodology for human movement tracking. By analysis of MAC address data in the study area, clear statistics such as staff's utilisation frequency, utilisation peak periods, and staff time spent is obtained. The analyses also reveal staff's socialising profiles in terms of group and solo gathering. The paper is concluded with a discussion on why MAC address tracking offers significant advantages for tracking human behaviour in terms of shared space utilisation with respect to other and more prominent technologies, and outlines some of its remaining deficiencies.},

By covering 22 locations in the study area with Bluetooth scanners, we were able to extract 152,487 trajectories generated by 80,828 detected visitors. Apart from generating clear statistics such as visitor counts, the share of returning visitors, and visitor flow maps, the analyses also reveal the complex nature of this event by hinting at the existence of several mutually different visitor profiles.

The article describes data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the size of the dataset and focuses on information addressing research questions. The results of analysis for the Seattle metropolitan area help to distinguish between sites that are occasionally popular among the photographers and can be considered as potential attractions from sites that are regularly visited and already known as city landmarks.

Our system will apply pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms to physical sensor measurements such as microphone and radio signals, but also to virtual sensor information such as call and message history and activity of messaging apps.

abstract = {WiFi in indoor environments exhibits spatio-temporal variations in terms of coverage and interference in typical WLAN deployments with multiple APs, motivating the need for automated monitoring to aid network administrators to adapt the WLAN deployment in order to match the user expectations. We develop Pazl, a mobile crowdsensing based indoor WiFi monitoring system that is enabled by a novel hybrid localization mechanism to locate individual measurements taken from participant phones. The localization mechanism in Pazl integrates the best aspects of two well known localization techniques, pedestrian dead reckoning and WiFi fingerprinting; it also relies on crowdsourcing for constructing the WiFi fingerprint database. Compared to existing WiFi monitoring systems based on static sniffers, Pazl is low cost and provides a user-side perspective. Pazl is significantly more automated than wireless site survey tools such as Ekahau Mobile Survey tool by drastically reducing the manual point-and-click based measurement location determination. We implement Pazl through a combination of Android mobile app and cloud backend application on the Google App Engine. Experimental evaluation of Pazl with a trial set of users shows that it yields similar results to manual site surveys but without the tedium.},

Type of antennas used and the environment's complexity such as trees for outdoor and partitions for indoor spaces highly affect the scanning range. The aforementioned challenges are empirically evaluated by “real” experiments using Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Scanners. The issues related to the antenna characteristics are also highlighted by experimenting with different antenna types.

abstract = {Crowd counting, which count or accurately estimate the number of human beings within a region, is critical in many applications, such as guided tour, crowd control and marketing research and analysis. A crowd counting solution should be scalable and be minimally intrusive (i.e., device-free) to users. Image-based solutions are device-free, but cannot work well in a dim or dark environment. Non-image based solutions usually require every human being carrying device, and are inaccurate and unreliable in practice. In this paper, we present FCC, a device-Free Crowd Counting approach based on Channel State Information (CSI). Our design is motivated by our observation that CSI is highly sensitive to environment variation, like a frog eye. We theoretically discuss the relationship between the number of moving people and the variation of wireless channel state. A major challenge in our design of FCC is to find a stable monotonic function to characterize the relationship between the crowd number and various features of CSI. To this end, we propose a metric, the Percentage of nonzero Elements (PEM), in the dilated CSI Matrix. The monotonic relationship can be explicitly formulated by the Grey Verhulst Model, which is used for crowd counting without a labor-intensive site survey. We implement FCC using off-the-shelf IEEE 802.11n devices and evaluate its performance via extensive experiments in typical real-world scenarios. Our results demonstrate that FCC outperforms the state-of-art approaches with much better accuracy, scalability and reliability.},

In detection step, we divide the crowd density into different levels according to the RSSI data obtained by WSNs using K-means algorithm. In calibration step, we eliminate the noises and other deviations estimation based on the spatial-temporal correlation of crowd distribution. In addition, we have implemented and evaluated our algorithm by extensive real-world experiments using 16 sensor nodes and large-scale simulations.

Each UIM experiment phone encompasses a Bluetooth scanner and a wifi scanner capturing both Bluetooth MAC addresses and wifi access point MAC addresses in proximity of the phone. Then, Bluetooth MAC addresses are used to infer contact information and the wifi MAC addresses are used to infer physical location of the phone. Using the contact and location information, we investigate first the sensitivity analysis on contact duration and inter-contact duration. Then, we characterize the regularity of people movement, visit duration of people at locations, and the popularity of locations. Finally, we present the Hybrid Epidemic data dissemination protocol, which uses both wifi access point and ad hoc contact to expedite the data forwarding. We evaluate Hybrid Epidemic protocol with our collected ad hoc and wifi traces and find that in comparison with Epidemic data dissemination protocol, the Hybrid Epidemic protocol improves data forwarding delay considerably.},

abstract = {In Pervasive Computing research, substantial work has been directed towards radio-based sensing of human movement patterns. This research has, however, mainly been focused on movements of individuals. This paper addresses the joint identification of the movement indoors of multiple persons forming a cohesive whole - specifically flocks - with clustering approaches operating on three different feature sets derived from WiFi signals which are comparatively analysed. Automatic detection of flocks has several important applications, including social and psychological sensing and emergency research studies. We use a dataset comprising 16 subjects forming one to four flocks walking in a building on single and multiple floors. For the detection of flocks we achieved an average F-measure accuracy of up to 85 percent. We report on the advantages and drawbacks of the three different types of feature sets considering their suitability for use {\&}{\#}x201C;in the wild{\&}{\#}x201D; or in well-defined environments.},

abstract = {Efficient evacuation of large buildings which seat more than twenty thousand people is a major challenge for building management authorities. Although many enterprise buildings have access control to count those entering various areas, such controls need to be switched off at times of emergency to avoid people getting trapped at a particular location. Hence, counting people during evacuation remains largely manual and error prone. Also, last known location based on access control from business management systems can be erroneous due to issues like tail gating. Accurate people counters like Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) often prove costly in large deployments. In this paper we present {\&}{\#}x201C;SmartEvacTrak{\&}{\#}x201D;, a low-cost evacuation system which can count people entering and exiting with over 98{\%} accuracy and can also localize people at a coarse level with around 97{\%} accuracy, from results obtained from an evacuation experiment performed on a set of 350+ people randomly exiting a building.},

abstract = {Yearly there's an influx of over three million Muslims to Makkah., Saudi Arabia to perform Hajj. As this large group of pilgrims move between the different religious sites safety and security becomes an issue of main concern. This research looks into the integration of different mobile technologies to serve the purpose of crowd management., people tracking and location based services. It explores the solution to track the movement of pilgrims via RFID technology. A location aware mobile solution will also be integrated into this. This will be made available to pilgrims with smartphones to enhance the accuracy and tracking time of the pilgrims and provide them with location based services for Hajj. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Wi-Fi in smartphones are designed to periodically transmit probe-request-frame to determine when a known access point is within range and by capitalizing this Wi-Fi behavior, crowd counting and analysis have been done by continuous monitoring and counting these Wi-Fi frames. The proliferation of Wi-Fi enabled mobile devices and the ever-increasing number of mobile devices in use, suggests opportunities for developing lowcost crowd counting and analysis solution. This work attempt to measure how well do monitoring and counting these Wi-Fi frames correlate with the actual number of people presence in a crowd. In this paper, we also compare the pros and cons of various crowd counting technologies, describe the system that we used for counting Wi-Fi frames and compare its accuracy against manual crowd counting technique in an event involving the public continuously for 8 hours. The results are promising, the correlation between manual counting and Wi-Fi frames counting is 0.89322. In addition to that, the Wi-Fi frames counting technique can even reveal the retention rate of the crowd.},

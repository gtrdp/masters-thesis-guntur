In the future work, we are interested in working more closely with estimating social density. Regression model based on the data to get the count of people. Machine learning method is also interesting to be implemented.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no approach that tries to combine or fusion several sensor measurements. Furthermore, no prior investigation of crowd counting using smartphone has been proposed, as mainly approaches are leveraging dedicated sensing devices.

This research is trying to bla bla.

Future work, examine the correlation between ap count and location.
future work, examine the solutino of mac address randomization using probe request data.

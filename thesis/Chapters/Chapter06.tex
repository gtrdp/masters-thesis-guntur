%************************************************
In the future work, we are interested in working more closely with estimating social density. Regression model based on the data to get the count of people. Machine learning method is also interesting to be implemented.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no approach that tries to combine or fusion several sensor measurements. Furthermore, no prior investigation of crowd counting using smartphone has been proposed, as mainly approaches are leveraging dedicated sensing devices.

mention the important message, that wifi could be use topredict roughly social density. but to generalize we must get more data.

This research is trying to bla bla.

Future work, examine the correlation between ap count and location.
future work, examine the solutino of mac address randomization using probe request data.

VAD might be a good candidate to detect whether there is a person speaking or not.

The result will be useful for BeHapp aplication [cite sociability]

Explain the limitation of the study.

use VAD

Explain that this method does not work in restricted environment, such as university location.
An the other limitation.

In appendix adds all result using line graph.

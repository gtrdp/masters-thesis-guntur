\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}
%************************************************

% - In each chapter, write intro and conclusion explicitly. Preferably a paragraph for each.
% - Good intro is:
% 	- linking to prev. chapter (explicitly)
% 	- explaining the aim of this chapter.
% 	- explaining how to achieve the aim.
% - Better to use active voice, avoid passive voice as much as possible.
% - Good conclusion brings an intro to the next chapter.

% ==============================================================================
% How the intro should be
% - explain about the conventional method of personal well being, which 
%   has a problem in biased result, eg., are you always socializing? the person
%   answer yes, in fact, he is not.
%   also explain about socialization, the importance of social density
%   if possible, cite prof. kas publication on social density
% - also mention social well being app, which is good for objective measurement,
%   but no approach on social density, explain their approaches.
% - here the objective social count comes in, as it can provide an objective
%   measurement of social density. explain the approaches (including wifi, camera, etc)
%   that have been proposed
% - explain what it lacks of, such as it does not applicable to smartphone, must be rooted
% - explain where we try to come in. and more about randomization and VAD.
% - explain the research questions

Social density estimation, or sometimes referred as crowd counting, is the mechanism of estimating the number of people in certain area by means of a proxy, which could replace the manual counting method. Social density estimation has broad range of implementation, for instance crowd surveillance~\cite{thesis050}, evacuation and rescue~\cite{thesis045}, retail store customer analysis, infrastructure development and evaluation, queue management~\cite{thesis012}, and even in behavioral monitoring. Currently, psychologist treat dementia patients by using questionnaires, which sometimes may be biased. For instance, when the psychologist asks the patients about their social activities, the patients may have forgotten their activities or they may answer the question as they like, which may lead to incorrect or biased result [\textbf{cite}].

Several method of social density estimation exists. Surveillance camera utilization is one of the method used, although it is limited by high deployment or computational cost. Other than image based estimation, some researches have proposed several method to estimate social density by means of RF signals, e.g., WiFi or Bluetooth, mainly to get more low deployment or computational cost.

The WiFi and Bluetooth based methods make use of several characteristic present in WiFi or Bluetooth, such as probe-request, MAC address monitoring [cite], Recieved Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) [cite], Link State Indicator (LSI) [cite], and Channel State Information (CSI) [cite]. From all of those methods, WiFi probe request seems promising, as it is also proven to be able to give social density estimation with high accuracy~\cite{}

% -> introduction about probe request
% -> why we dont do it directly on phone, because of permission (rooting)
% -> explain that it capables to show social density, cite the paper
% -> explain that behapp is already counting available access point also cite
However, doing it in smartphone directly is impossible, as it requires root permission nad rooting is illegal according to most countries' law. As extension of research BeHapp.

% -> explanation about mac address randomization

% -> summary of this work
% -> how do we would like to achieve this
% -> how long is the project
This study serves as 

% any relation of unique device and access point count?
To uncover the relation between the number of unique devices and available access points, I formulated the first research question:
\begin{displayquote}\textit{
Is there any correlation between number of unique devices and number of available Access Points in a certain area?}
\end{displayquote}

% how do the parameters affect?
When the data is captured, several parameters are also used, such as location, time, duration, and so on. Here comes the second:
\begin{displayquote}\textit{
How do the parameters affect the correlation result?}
\end{displayquote}

% how to resolve the randomization issue?
As mentioned previously, MAC address randomization is one of the challenges of estimating nearby unique device using probe-request. The third research question is somewhat related to that:
\begin{displayquote}\textit{
Is there any method to overcome the MAC address randomization issue? Which affecting number of unique devices.}
\end{displayquote}

% is VAD useful?
Furthermore, the validation using sound is also used and the last research question is asking about the effect of it.
\begin{displayquote}\textit{
How does validation using Voice Activity Detection help to achieve better result?}
\end{displayquote}

The rest of this thesis is structured as follows. Chapter \ref{ch:related-work} describes the related works, which are closely related to the social density estimation.

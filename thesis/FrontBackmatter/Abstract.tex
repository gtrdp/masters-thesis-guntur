\chapter*{Abstract}
Estimating social density may come useful for several occasions. Thus, several methods have been proposed to tackle this issue. However, the methods are still not able to deliver really accurate result compared to manual counting of people.

This research presents the correlation between number of unique devices and available Access Points in a particular location. WiFi probe-request is used to determine the unique devices. Furthermore, a cross-validation by using voice activity detection is used to determine whether a person is present.

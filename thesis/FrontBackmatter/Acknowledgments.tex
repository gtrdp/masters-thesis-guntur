\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
First and foremost, I would like to thank God, the Almighty, for having made everything possible by giving me strength and courage to do this work.\\

\noindent
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my primary supervisor Prof. Alexander Lazovik for the continuous support with my thesis and related re- search; for his patience, motivation, and immense knowledge. His guidance helped me in all the time of research and I could not have imagined having a better adviser and mentor. I would also like to thank my thesis supervisors: Dr. Apostolos Ampatzoglou and Dr. Andrea Pagani, for their insightful comments, encouragement and trust. My sincere thanks for Dr. Andrea Pagani, who provided me his value-able feedback on my thesis manuscript.\\

\noindent
Last but not the least, I would like to thank my family: my parents and my brother for supporting me spiritually throughout working on this thesis and my my life in general.

abstract = {The IEEE 802.11 standard defines Wi-Fi probe requests as a active mechanism with which mobile devices can request information from access points and accelerate the Wi-Fi connection process.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nResearchers in previous work have identified privacy hazards associated$\backslash$r$\backslash$nwith Wi-Fi probe requests, such as leaking past access points identifiers and user mobility. Besides several efforts to develop$\backslash$r$\backslash$nprivacy-preserving alternatives, modern mobile devices continue to use Wi-Fi probe requests. In this work, we quantify Wi-Fi probe requests' threat to privacy by conducting an experimental study of$\backslash$r$\backslash$nthe most popular smartphones in different settings. Our objective is to identify how different factors influence the probing frequency and the average number of broadcasted probes. Our conclusions are$\backslash$r$\backslash$nworrisome: On average, some mobile devices send probe requests as often as 55 times per hour, thus revealing their unique MAC address at high frequency. Even if a mobile device is not charging and in sleep mode, it might broadcast about 2000 probes per hour. We also evaluate a commercially deployed MAC address randomization$\backslash$r$\backslash$nmechanism, and demonstrate a simple method to re-identify anonymized probes},

abstract = {Reliable automatic detection of speech/non-speech activity in degraded, noisy audio signals is a fundamental and challenging task in robust signal processing. As various speech technology applications rely on the accuracy of a Voice Activity Detection (VAD) system for their effectiveness and robustness, the problem has gained considerable research interest over the years. It has been shown that in highly distorted conditions, an accurate segmentation of the target speech can be achieved by combining multiple feature streams. In this paper, we extract four one-dimensional streams each attempting to separate speech from the disturbing background by exploiting a different speech-related characteristic, i.e. (i) the spectral shape, (ii) spectro-temporal modulations, (iii) the periodicity structure due to the presence of pitch harmonics, and (iv) the long-term spectral variability profile. The information from these streams is then expanded over long duration context windows and applied to the input layer of a standard Multilayer Perceptron classifier. The proposed VAD was evaluated on the DARPA RATS corpora and shows to be very competitive to current state-of-the art systems. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 ISCA.},

abstract = {Smartphones are excellent mobile sensing platforms, with the microphone in particular being exercised in several audio in- ference applications. We take smartphone audio inference a step further and demonstrate for the first time that it's possi- ble to accurately estimate the number of people talking in a certain place – with an average error distance of 1.5 speak- ers – through unsupervised machine learning analysis on au- dio segments captured by the smartphones. Inference occurs transparently to the user and no human intervention is needed to derive the classification model. Our results are based on the design, implementation, and evaluation of a system called Crowd++, involving 120 participants in 10 very different en- vironments. We show that no dedicated external hardware or cumbersome supervised learning approaches are needed but only off-the-shelf smartphones used in a transparent manner. We believe our findings have profound implications in many research fields, including social sensing and personal wellbe- ing assessment.},

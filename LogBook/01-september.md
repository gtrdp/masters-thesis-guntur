	- Working on SME TA.
- **Wed Sep 14 10:16:12 CEST 2016**
	- Working on SME TA, in the morning.
	- Reading 026, 031, 030, 028, 020, 009
	- http://ohmage.org/ would be interesting to see. -> Looks like it is not updated anymore.
	- 031 seems to be very similar in methods. It reveals several interesting methods.
	- More WiFi literatures are needed.
	- Look for WiFi probe request in Android.
- **Thu Sep 15 09:29:49 CEST 2016**
	- Looking for and printing new literature.
	- Continue literature review: 001, 006, 040, 041
	- cannot find a literature that combines WiFi proxy and online signals (one uses probe request).
- **Fri Sep 16 11:28:14 CEST 2016**
	- Literature review: 041, 042, 043, 022
	- Learn about confision matrix, because some of the work use that.
	- I think it is hard to find a reliable source ground truth for our work.
	
- **Sat Sep 17 14:56:27 CEST 2016**
	- Continue Literature: 022, 033, 045
	- Getting `probe request` meaning makes the WiFi in monitoring mode (cannot be used as normal device for internet).
	- The problem is:
		- how to distinguish between people (represented by smartphone) and AP.
		- how to know that the person is within the eyesight of the person, because the WiFi probe request might be received but no human is in eyesight.
	- To be able to detect `probe request`, android must be set to `monitor mode`, which requires root privilege.
		- It also depends on the chipset of the Android, not all device supports `monitor mode`.
		- More read: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2334244/is-there-any-way-to-put-android-wifi-droid-handset-into-promiscuous-monitoring
	- A good example: https://www.kismetwireless.net/android-pcap/
		- But it requires a USB NIC that supports `monitor mode`.
	- Bluetooth is only possible to count crowd, or estimates. Because it is counting only within 10% of real people count.
	- Rooting or jailbreaking is considered illegal in some countries: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/illegal-root-android-jailbreak-iphone/
	- Look for possible other work that use `wifi probe request` in `thesis014`.
	- Look more about F-Measure.
	- Got many papers which seem relevant with crowd counting using probe request in WiFi.
	- Command to scan for probe request in Linux/Mac:

			sudo tcpdump -In -i en0 -e -s 256 type mgt subtype probe-req

- **Sun Sep 18 17:10:56 CEST 2016**
	- Continue literature: 047, 057
	- Look for how to calculate accuracy:
		- F-measure
		- R value (?)
		- correlation
	- Challenges, how to define the time of scanning. and figure out where to perform the scanning, which has a good spot (good point of view) for counting. Possible option:
		- Grotemarkt
		- Vismarkt
		- Academy gebouw
		- Bernoulliborg
		- Noorder plantsoen (with walking and recording video).
		- Duisenberg library
	- Another challenges: (i) using direct people count, (ii) using quantized counting level as proposed in some papers.
	- `[Possible problem]` A drawback of scanning WiFi probe request: people located in other room (not within the person's eyesight) is still detectable, thus, worsen the results.
		- Combine with sound
		- Combine with GPS location if there is no sound detected.
	- Look for how to do a thesis in a proper way.
	- `[Possible novelty]` To filter the data, i.e., to remove laptops or other device, use known MAC address filter.
	- A device that scans for Wi-Fi or Bluetooth devices is available: Meshlium http://www.libelium.com/products/meshlium/

	- Bluetooth, WiFi and ambient sound, might be good candidates for objective social density measurement. 
	- `[Possible Method]` When measuring the WiFi packets (or any other source of data), please do that when the phone is
		- Inside the pocket, or bag.
		- Hold in the hand.
	- `[Suggestion]` Test the method firstly, by conducting a short-timed experiment, before going to the real experiment.

		- Is rooting an issue (illegal)? 
		- Is it better to have direct crowd count or using quantization?
		- Counting people using wifi has an issue: it can detect people through the walls, which people don't see. what do you think?

- **Wed Sep 21 10:10:26 CEST 2016**
	- Skype call with Niels. Some insights:
		- This work is going to be helpful for BeHapp app.
		- Try to find a correlation between probe request (proxy of people count), which indicates unique device and number of access point [novelty] in a particular area.
		- There is an issue with MAC address randomization, try to find a solution `probably solved in one of the paper`.
			- Possibly use a RSSI as a measurement.
		- If possible, also develop a model of wifi access point with the number of unique device.
			- So, if we have the access point count in BeHapp, we could infer the social density.
		- Got more literature.
	- Create simple presentation.
	- Devise a research proposal before meeting with Niels at 11.
	- Wisuda Didin.
	- Try to settle in one place until the end of the day. That way, you can save lot of time, rather than finding a place to stay.
	- Please be on time, in the morning, otherwise you will get no place to work.
	- Look for MAC address randomization.
	- `[Notice]` Becareful with WiFi channels, please scann all channels.
	- Interesing, for MAC address randomization in iOS.
	- `[Suggestions for Research]` Try to filter out other devices, e.g., tablets, or laptops, and see what happens.
	- `[Suggestions for Research]` Try to use different variable:
		- Location (classified in: remote area, crowded place, city center, indoor, outdoor)
		- Duration of scanning (15 mins, 30 mins, 45 mins)
		- Filter
		- Phone manufacturer
		- Operating System
		- number of sent probes per device
		- show the graph of scanned device (comparison between laptops, smartphones, and other)
	- Literature: 061
	- Both Android and iOS employ MAC address randomization.

- **Thu Sep 22 10:40:12 CEST 2016**
	- Make sure that you read the key literature (one which is similar) and make sure whether it contains proxy between social density and WiFi/BT signals.
	- Find how complicated is the other masters thesis.
		- Basically they have 1 to 3 research questions.
		- One is the main question, while several others are the subquestions.

September #5
--------------------------------
- **Mon Sep 26 09:57:10 CEST 2016**
	- Looking for a library for sound ambience.
		- Keyword: Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
		- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_activity_detection
		- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talkspurt
		- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfort_noise
	- Detect voice activity and measure the intensity (dB).
	- VAD is, I assume, used only when the voice is clearly heard. It is unknown whether the usage is also possible where crowd is present.
	- `[Possible experiment]` Also try to do **moving** experiment, using Raspberry with WiFi monitor.
		- Why don't we always use Raspberry Pi to achieve unified result?
	- Several libraries for voice activity detection:
		- https://github.com/mvansegbroeck/vad
		- https://github.com/pckben/vad
		- https://github.com/shunsukeaihara/vad_for_voip
		- https://github.com/kdavis-mozilla/vad.js
	- Experimental setup: https://www.reference.com/science/experimental-setup-science-1e292d23676da70
	- Writing experimental setup draft.
	- Good reading for correlation topic:
		- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence
		- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality
	- As we are looking for correlation, use pearson correlation coefficient.
	- Starting to write something for the thesis.

- **Tue Sep 27 10:13:34 CEST 2016**
	- Separate the Logbook into separate months.
	- Install and test Wireshark.
	- Install and test matlab with VAD code.
	- Learn How VAD works.
	- Bring Raspberry Pi and make it ready for sensing the WiFi probe request.
	- The output of VAD is boolean, whether the voice is present or not.
		- The technology we need is somewhat different, with the ability to count the number of crowd roughtly.
	- A good tutorial about VAD: http://practicalcryptography.com/miscellaneous/machine-learning/voice-activity-detection-vad-tutorial/
	- Learning about VAD, machine learning, and counting crowd using smartphone speaker.
		- Using youtube videos.
	- `[Notes]` Machine Learning is categorized to 3 categories:
		- Supervised learning
		- Unsupervised learning
		- Re-inforcement learning
	- `[Notes]` Machine Learning Notes:
		- Features: the feature that we use to explain the data. usually received from the training data
		- Classifiers: the algorithm to classify the training data
			- ANN (Artificial Neural Network)
			- Support Vecto Machine
			- Decision Tree
			- Nice image that explains several classifiers: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/_images/plot_classifier_comparison_001.png
		- Iris: classic dataset for Machine learning problem, which is good for practice.
		- Tips for ML: choose the best feature that describes your data best.
		- Good Library for Machine Learning: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/
	- **Possible research**: generate separate graph that explain one location with different time window: using scatter plot.
		- http://mste.illinois.edu/courses/ci330ms/youtsey/scatterinfo.html
	- **Possible explanation**: explain that the number of access point might increase in a crowd because of the ad hoc access point.
		- also use https://wigle.net/ database of public WiFi
		- explain that monitoring of probe request in smartphone is impossible due to the permission (root access).
	- **Possible location**: scan also in other public crowd, where a lot of people are present
	- **Possible features**: for estimating social density, the feature might be:
		- count of unique MAC address WiFi device (only phone)
		- count of unique MAC address Bluetooth device (only phone)
		- count of unique Access point count
		- validation of microphone sound
		- Ground truth: actual number of people
	- Working on example VAD matlab code, got stuck in the directory (unable to read the files).
	- Working on the thesis draft again.

- **Wed Sep 28 08:53:39 CEST 2016**
	- Preparing Raspberry Pi -> need DHCP enabled router and Internet connection: probably at home
		- Setting up the Raspberry for remote connection.
		- The monitoring mode using `tcpdump` or `iw dev` does not work, trying to switch to `aircrack-ng`.
		- Unable to set the `wlan0` up, even when using `aircrack-ng`. According to `aircrack-ng` error possibly other process is causing this error.

				Error -16 likely means your card was set back to station mode by something.

		- Complete error message:

				Your kernel supports rfkill but you don't have rfkill installed.
				To ensure devices are unblocked you must install rfkill.

	- Learn how TCP Dump works.
		- Study the structure of TCP dump logs.
	- Read literature about counting crowd using microphone.
	- Helping SME students (took some time).
	- Found the source code of Crowd++:
		- https://github.com/lendlice/crowdpp
		- https://github.com/gtrdp/crowdpp (forked)

- **Thu Sep 29 09:35:53 CEST 2016**
	- Write a script to automate the experiment.
		- Switching between counting APs and probe request
		- Write the result to a log.
	- Reviewing speaker count papers: 069, 067, 071, 072, 073, 075, 074
	- **Thesis writing notes**:
		- In each chapter, write intro and conclusion explicitly. Preferably a paragraph for each.
		- Good intro is:
			- linking to prev. chapter (explicitly)
			- explaining the aim of this chapter.
			- explaining how to achieve the aim.
		- Better to use active voice, avoid passive voice as much as possible.
		- Good conclusion brings an intro to the next chapter.
	- Some method to capture packets:
		- Using `tcpdump` to save to `.pcap` file. Then converting it to `.txt` file.
		- Using `tcpdump` and save the output directly to `.txt` file.
	- Looking for a method to scan available AP.
	- Testing robust VAD again.
		- Successfully make the matlab program works.
		- `mvansegbroeck/vad` requires `wav` input, which tends to be very big.
		- Problem:
			- how if the audio duration is so long
			- how to refactor the graph to fit with the requirement graph.
	- Still figuring out how to run the `crowdpp` app. The `.apk` file is found however, possibly can install that.
	- Unable to run the `monitor mode` on raspberry with Tenda WiFi dongle. Possibly because the chipset is not supported.
		- Probably should buy another WiFi dongle (with antenna preferably).
	- Trying to install tenda in MacBook.
		- Couldn't find a driver for Mac.
		- Trying using virtual device.
	- Successfully ran `monitoring mode` in macbook, in Linux (virtual), using `aircrack-ng`
		- The result far less in count compared with in Mac.

- **Fri Sep 30 10:21:45 CEST 2016**
	- Setting up raspberry pi.
		- Probably need a non-gui distro, as the gui might be using the wifi, thus causing troubles (resource not available). -> **Does not work**
	- To scan for WiFi Accesspoint in Mac:
		- Frist create link to bin folder:

				sudo ln -s /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport /usr/local/bin/airport

		- Then run the command:

				airport -s

	- Create a script to automate the process.
		- Done.
	- **Possible research** Use a time window to show the result. Different time window might have different result.
	- Raspberry Pi not working with wifi. Even if using GUI, it does not work anymore. It used to work though.
	- Tried to write something for thesis.
	- **Possible Research** Try to do the experiment in bus.

- **Sat Oct  1 18:16:35 CEST 2016**
	- Ran data collection at for around 30-50 mins:
		- IKEA
		- Kang Fajar's house
		- Grotemarkt
	- Learning which is better for data analysis.
		- Decided to use python because:
			- Python is good for developer, and I'm a developer.
			- Python code is extendable and implementable to production environment, while R is not (it is intended to run in a single computer).
			- Python has a broad library for data science and machine learning, which I may probably need in the future.
		- Why not R:
			- R has a steep learning curve especially for developer, so I must be able to learn that very easily.
		- Good comparison: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-or-python-for-data-analysis

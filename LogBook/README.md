- **Tue Sep 13 10:15:14 CEST 2016**
	- Working on SME TA.
- **Wed Sep 14 10:16:12 CEST 2016**
	- Working on SME TA, in the morning.
	- Reading 026, 031, 030, 028, 020, 009
	- http://ohmage.org/ would be interesting to see. -> Looks like it is not updated anymore.
	- 031 seems to be very similar in methods. It reveals several interesting methods.
	- More WiFi literatures are needed.
	- Look for WiFi probe request in Android.
- **Thu Sep 15 09:29:49 CEST 2016**
	- Looking for and printing new literature.
	- Continue literature review: 001, 006, 040, 041
	- cannot find a literature that combines WiFi proxy and online signals (one uses probe request).
- **Fri Sep 16 11:28:14 CEST 2016**
	- Literature review: 041, 042, 043, 022
	- Learn about confision matrix, because some of the work use that.
	- I think it is hard to find a reliable source ground truth for our work.
	
- **Sat Sep 17 14:56:27 CEST 2016**
	- Continue Literature: 022, 033, 045
	- Getting `probe request` meaning makes the WiFi in monitoring mode (cannot be used as normal device for internet).
	- The problem is:
		- how to distinguish between people (represented by smartphone) and AP.
		- how to know that the person is within the eyesight of the person, because the WiFi probe request might be received but no human is in eyesight.
	- To be able to detect `probe request`, android must be set to `monitor mode`, which requires root privilege.
		- It also depends on the chipset of the Android, not all device supports `monitor mode`.
		- More read: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2334244/is-there-any-way-to-put-android-wifi-droid-handset-into-promiscuous-monitoring
	- A good example: https://www.kismetwireless.net/android-pcap/
		- But it requires a USB NIC that supports `monitor mode`.
	- Bluetooth is only possible to count crowd, or estimates. Because it is counting only within 10% of real people count.
	- Rooting or jailbreaking is considered illegal in some countries: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/illegal-root-android-jailbreak-iphone/
	- Look for possible other work that use `wifi probe request` in `thesis014`.
	- Look more about F-Measure.
	- Got many papers which seem relevant with crowd counting using probe request in WiFi.
	- Command to scan for probe request in Linux/Mac:

			sudo tcpdump -In -i en0 -e -s 256 type mgt subtype probe-req

- **Sun Sep 18 17:10:56 CEST 2016**
	- Continue literature: 047, 057
	- Look for how to calculate accuracy:
		- F-measure
		- R value (?)
		- correlation
	- Challenges, how to define the time of scanning. and figure out where to perform the scanning, which has a good spot (good point of view) for counting. Possible option:
		- Grotemarkt
		- Vismarkt
		- Academy gebouw
		- Bernoulliborg
		- Noorder plantsoen (with walking and recording video).
		- Duisenberg library
	- Another challenges: (i) using direct people count, (ii) using quantized counting level as proposed in some papers.
	- `[Possible problem]` A drawback of scanning WiFi probe request: people located in other room (not within the person's eyesight) is still detectable, thus, worsen the results.
		- Combine with sound
		- Combine with GPS location if there is no sound detected.
	- Look for how to do a thesis in a proper way.
	- `[Possible novelty]` To filter the data, i.e., to remove laptops or other device, use known MAC address filter.
	- A device that scans for Wi-Fi or Bluetooth devices is available: Meshlium http://www.libelium.com/products/meshlium/

September #4
--------------------------------
- **Mon Sep 19 09:41:44 CEST 2016**
	- Prepare list of questions.
	- Literature: 053, 060, 044, 051, 052, 058, 048
	- Possibly look for official WiFi technical specification from wifi.org.
	- `[Possible feature]` Filter based on RSSI. Find a literature that says the threshold of WiFi signal.
	- `[Possible challenges]` MAC randomization in iOS8 devices.
		- Possible ways, filtering: randomized MACs does not comply with IEEE standards [thesis053]
	- What is CDF?
	- Literature review searching:
		- Using several keywords
		- Getting the literature from bibliography of the paper
		- From author name, for possible other publication
	- `[Possible tips]` Please make sure that rooting an android phone is not breaking the law.
		- http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/illegal-root-android-jailbreak-iphone/
		- http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:111:0016:0022:EN:PDF
	- Bluetooth, WiFi and ambient sound, might be good candidates for objective social density measurement. 
	- `[Possible Method]` When measuring the WiFi packets (or any other source of data), please do that when the phone is
		- Inside the pocket, or bag.
		- Hold in the hand.
	- `[Suggestion]` Test the method firstly, by conducting a short-timed experiment, before going to the real experiment.
	- Also give graph of MAC address manufacturer.
	- Random question: Why WiFI can improve accuracy in smartphone location (as often asked when opening google maps)?


- **Tue**
	- List of Questions:
		- one 
		- two
		- three
- **Wed**
- **Thu**
	- Make sure that you read the key literature (one which is similar) and make sure whether it contains proxy between social density and WiFi/BT signals.
- **Fri Aug 26 10:30:00 CEST 2016**
	- Literature Review Presentation.

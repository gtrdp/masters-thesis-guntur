	- Counting heads.
	- Extracting the data and creating graphs.
	
- **Tue Nov  1 20:08:01 CET 2016**
	- Call Niels:
		- Explain by conclusion, not using whole data
			- effect of day
			- effect of location
			- effect of scanning time
			- put it in a whole picture
			- signal strength: WiFi and probe request
		- Explain the MAC address randomization.
		- Working on decibels.
			- https://support.biamp.com/General/Audio/Peak_vs_RMS_Meters
			- **Important, writing**: also address the microphone sensitivity.
			- https://support.biamp.com/General/Audio/Microphone_sensitivity
			- Sound level decreases by 6dB with each doubling of distance from the source.
			- The sound is already using ambient noise reduction.
			- Those microphones are attuned to a specific (and rather narrow) range of sound intensity.
		- Found a magazine that explain the microphone sensitivity.

- **Wed Nov  2 12:06:43 CET 2016**
	- Working on getting the RMS and the Peak level using SoX.
	- Please try to make your working hours more productive.
	- Work on the conference paper.
	- Most modern microphone has built in ambient noise reduction.
